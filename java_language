I am learning java recently, reading Java tutorial, and code some example. I found a very interesting phenominan:
        System.out.println("Math.rint(100.500): "+Math.rint(100.500));  ==> Math.rint(100.500): 100.0
        System.out.println("Math.rint(101.500): "+Math.rint(101.500));  ==> Math.rint(101.500): 102.0
        System.out.println("Math.rint(99.500): "+Math.rint(99.500));    ==> Math.rint(99.500): 100.0
        System.out.println("Math.rint(10.500): "+Math.rint(10.500));    ==> Math.rint(10.500): 10.0
  In the above examples, rint(double d) is a function that will return the integer that is closest in value to the argument.
  But why the results are different between two groups (10.500,100.500) and (99.500,101.500)? 
  Is it because the integer part of the first group can be modified by 10? No result until now.
