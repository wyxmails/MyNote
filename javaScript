problems:
  How to initialize Object through json(made by server side)? 
  Assemble JsonObject with java on server side and then return, use Ext to decode the json data,
  get the data by its key, the highchart can process the series data and represent in line/pie/area/column/3d/scatter and so on.
  But some of the value I can not get.
  I add key x and its value in server side, but can not get the value in tooltip with this.x, but can get this.y,
  do not know what is the reason.
